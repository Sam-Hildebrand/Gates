# Gates:
A command line implementation of a Digital logic simulator in python.

It works as sort of a "self-modifying package" where each new gate you create is converted to actual python code within the package.

You can implement any digital logic with simply the "AndGate" and "NotGate" builtins, however, since it's a personal project I've included some other gates I've implemented.
