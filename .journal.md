**12/2/2020, 12:49:26 PM**: I need a viable way to represent two bits out of a gate. i.e:
```drawdown.flow.gates
    - input.
    - gate.
        - output1.
    - output2.
```
One possible method is a list, where `returned[i]` represents 1 or 0 times 10^i.

Simple Concept for a gate sketcher: This will not be terribly easy to implement and so is probably a little way off.
```
NandGate:
input1---+---------+    +---------+
         | AndGate +----+ NotGate +---output1
input2---+---------+    +---------+
```
